Cloud providers typically offer the ability to auto-scale Virtual Machines.  Two of the more common auto-scaling offerings are [Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/virtual-machine-scale-sets/) (VMSS) and [AWS Auto Scaling](https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/) (ASG).  This section will walk you through how to configure Octopus Deploy to best work with Auto Scaling Virtual Machines.

# Recommendations

When creating your first VMSS or ASG you will be presented with a series of decisions to make.  We have created a page to help guide you through those questions.
