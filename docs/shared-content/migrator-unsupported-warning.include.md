With the release of the [Export/Import Projects](/docs/projects/export-import/index.md) feature in **Octopus 2021.1** and with Config as Code on the horizon the migrator has fewer users are using it.  While the migrator will continue to run, any non-showstopping bugs found in the migrator will be low priority.  No new features are planned for the migrator.    

Our recommendation is to move to using Export/Import Projects feature to move projects between instances (or spaces).  Or, leverage additional tooling such as the [Octopus Terraform Provider](https://octopus.com/blog/octopusdeploy-terraform-provider) or [Space Cloner](https://github.com/OctopusDeployLabs/SpaceCloner).
