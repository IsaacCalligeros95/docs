**Octopus Deploy 2019.1** introduced [Spaces](/docs/administration/spaces/index.md) as a way to isolate team/divisions/projects from one another.  Before configuring spaces, there are a few important items to note.

- Spaces are "hard walls," each space has its environments, lifecycles, projects, packages, step templates, and targets.
- At the time of this writing, the only thing shared between spaces is users and teams.
- A user can have full permissions in one space but read-only permissions in all other spaces.
- Listening Tentacles can be registered to multiple spaces and only count against your license once.

## Configuring Spaces

As spaces are "hard walls," you should consider how often your users will need to switch between spaces in their usual day-to-day work.  We've found customers have the most success when spaces are decoupled from one another.  For example:

- A space containing all the projects that comprise an application suite.  For example, all the applications and projects for your CRM.
- A space for public-facing applications with another space for all internal applications.
- A space for each division within your company.

Internally we have opted for a space per application suite.

- Octopus Server Space (includes the MSI, pushing to Chocolatey and Docker Hub)
- Octopus.com Space (and corresponding CMS)
- Integrations Space (build servers, issue trackers, etc.)
- And so on

## Anti-Patterns

We've also found several anti-patterns with the Spaces feature you should avoid.

- A space per team (Team A Space, Team B space, etc.).  Typically in larger corporations, applications move between teams; a space per team would require you to move projects between spaces all the time.
- A space per environment (Development Space, Production Space, Test Space, etc.).  Spaces were not designed, nor do they support this scenario.  You would need a way to keep the deployment process in sync across multiple spaces.
- A space per tenant.  Just like the environments per space scenario, spaces were not designed, nor do they support this scenario.  You would need a way to keep the deployment process in sync across multiple spaces.
- A space per application component.  You would need to track a single application across multiple spaces.
- Sharing deployment targets across spaces.  It is possible to register the same listening Tentacle, Azure Web App, or K8s cluster across spaces, but that indicates a space is too fine-grained.  Sharing deployment targets across spaces only lead to confusion as deployments in one space will appear "locked" because of deployment in another space.

## Prevent Sharing of Deployment Targets

To prevent sharing of deployment targets and workers across spaces, the easiest solution is to use [polling Tentacles](/docs/infrastructure/deployment-targets/windows-targets/tentacle-communication.md).  A polling Tentacle can only be registered to a single space.

For other deployment targets, such as Azure Web Apps, or K8s clusters, you would have to re-key the credentials in each space.  As such, store those credentials in a secure location and limit access to them.

## Sharing Workers

Sharing workers configured as listening Tentacles is very easy to do.  In a lot of cases, the servers hosting the workers are underutilized.  Sharing workers between spaces can be beneficial from a cost and maintenance standpoint.

There are some considerations when sharing workers.
- The Tentacle agent on the worker can be running as a specific Active Directory account.  If you need to limit that account access, you should use a polling Tentacle and register it to one specific space.
- The Tentacle agent could be running on an EC2 instance with a specific IAM role attached.  Just like above, to limit access to that IAM role, you should use a polling Tentacle and register it to one specific space.
- When workers download packages, they require a mutex; no other task can be running on that worker.  99% of the time, this isn't noticed.  However, if a worker runs a 10-hour integration test, you run the risk of getting stuck behind that test waiting for the mutex to be created.

## Moving Projects Between Spaces

Don't worry if you don't get your space configuration right the first time.  It is a high bar to expect perfection the first time.

Starting with **Octopus Server 2021.1** we offer the ability to [export and import projects between spaces](/docs/projects/export-import/index.md).  You can configure your instance with every project using the default space.  You can decide later how you want to split up your instance.
