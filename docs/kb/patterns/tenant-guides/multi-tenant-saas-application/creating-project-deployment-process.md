In this part of the guide, we'll create our deployment process to deploy our package to our deployment targets.  In this scenario, we have the following steps:

* Send slack message to notify team of deployment
* Create MySQL database
* Migrate Database Changes
* Deploy App to Azure App Service 
* Apply custom branding 
* Send Slack message on succesful deployment
* Send Slack message on failed deployment

The step named **Apply Custom Branding** only needs to run for tenants that have a tenant tag of `Branding` associated with them. 

To configure this, go into your step, under **Conditions**, expand the **Tenants** option and select the `Branding` tag from the `Custom Feature` Tag set.

This will ensure this step only runs for tenants that have the `Branding` tag applied.

The final step in the guide will [create and deploy a release](/docs/tenants/guides/multi-tenant-saas-application/creating-project-release.md) of our application.
