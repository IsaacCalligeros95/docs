The first step in this guide is to create the three teams needed for this scenario as tenants:

- Team Avengers
- Team Radical
- QA

To create your tenants follow these steps:

!include <tenants-create-tenant>

Repeat this process for each of the tenants, and then move on to the next section in the guide.
