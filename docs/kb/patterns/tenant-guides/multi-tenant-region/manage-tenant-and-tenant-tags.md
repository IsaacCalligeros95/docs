Each store in the Car Rental chain is named after the city or location they are in.  To ensure that the application is deployed to the correct location with the correct features, we must associate each tenant with the correct tags.

## Managing Tenant Tag Sets for Tenants
To manage the Tag Sets associated with a Tenant, navigate to Tenants, then select the Tenant to manage.  Click on **MANAGE TAGS** to edit which tags are associated to a Tenant
