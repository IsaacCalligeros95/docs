To implement blue-green deployments in Octopus using [Environments](/docs/infrastructure/environments/index.md), create two environments - one for blue, and one for green:

When deploying, you can then choose which environment to deploy to - either blue or green. The dashboard will show which release is in each environment.

Configuring your [lifecycle](/docs/releases/lifecycles/index.md) will need to be done accordingly. Typically you would have both your blue and green environments in a shared "Production/Staging" phase.
