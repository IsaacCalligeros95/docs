With the release of the [Export/Import Projects](/docs/projects/export-import/index.md) feature in **Octopus 2021.1** and Config as Code reaching EAP the need for the migrator is diminishing.  While the migrator will continue to run, any non-showstopping bugs found in the migrator will be low priority.  No new features are planned for the migrator.    

Our recommendation is to upgrade to the latest version of Octopus Deploy and start using the Export/Import Projects feature to move projects between instances (or spaces).  Or, leverage additional tooling such as the [Octopus Terraform Provider](https://octopus.com/blog/octopusdeploy-terraform-provider) or [Space Cloner](https://github.com/OctopusDeployLabs/SpaceCloner).
