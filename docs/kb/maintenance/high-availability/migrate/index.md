You may already have an existing Octopus Server that you wish to make highly available. The process to migrate to Octopus High Availability is the same as the process detailed in [Configuring High Availability for Octopus](/docs/administration/high-availability/configure/index.md), except your existing server will be the **first node** in the cluster.

1. Provision the shared storage folder.
2. Move the SQL Server Database, if necessary.
3. Use the `Octopus.Server.exe path` [command](/docs/octopus-rest-api/octopus.server.exe-command-line/path.md) to tell Octopus to use the shared storage folder.
4. Move the existing task logs, packages, and artifacts from the existing Octopus Server node into the shared storage folders.
5. Add the additional nodes and load balancer as required.
