Octopus Deploy provides first-class support for deploying Terraform templates.

The `Apply a Terraform template` step can be used to create or update a resources from a Terraform template, while the `Destroy Terraform resources` step can be used to destroy existing Terraform resources.

**Where do Terraform Steps execute?**

All Terraform steps execute on a worker. By default, that will be the built-in worker in the Octopus Server. Learn about [workers](/docs/infrastructure/workers/index.md) and the different configuration options.

:::warning
If the Terraform tool is updated above version `0.11`, you are using an Octopus version prior to **2020.5.0**, and you are using the **Source Code** option within a Terraform step, you will receive syntax warnings within Octopus. You can update the Terraform tool to a version higher than `0.11` without issue in an Octopus version prior to **2020.5.0** only if you use the **File inside a package** option within the terraform step.

## Specific messages

The Terraform steps have some unique messages that may be displayed in the output if there is something important to note as part of deployment. Below is a list of these messages.

### Terraform-Configuration-UntestedTerraformCLIVersion

The Terraform steps in Octopus Deploy are tested against a range of versions of the Terraform CLI from 0.11.15 to 1.0.0. As new versions of Terraform are released, testing will be expanded to include these versions to ensure that they are compatible with the Terraform steps in Octopus. In the meantime, if the Terraform CLI version used in a step is outside the tested range a message will be displayed in the output indicating this. The Terraform step will likely continue to run successfully even if the CLI version being used has not been tested in Octopus. If the step succeeds, then the message will be informational only, and there is no action that needs to be taken. If the step resulted in an error, then the message will be a warning; however, the error may not be related to the version of Terraform being used.
